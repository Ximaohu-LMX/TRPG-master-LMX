"""Player-safe projection over ModuleContent v3 (#212 §7, §4, §8).

The v2 projection walked `Scene.entity_ids` and `Scene.exits`, which is why it
could only ever answer "what is in this room" and "what other rooms exist". v3
splits those apart:

* **hierarchy** — `parent_location_id`, projected as a breadcrumb, so the UI can
  say 阿诺兹堡 - 金博尔宅 - 书房 without that implying reachability;
* **navigation** — `location_edges`, which is what actually decides where the
  actor may go, and which can stop at an `access_point_id` boundary instead of
  either succeeding or failing outright;
* **placement** — an Entity declares `located_in`, so an entity moved by
  `move_entity` is projected wherever it now is rather than wherever the module
  originally listed it.

`GameState.scene_id` keeps its name during the migration but holds a v3 location
id; renaming the field is a storage change and belongs with the loader switch.
